# Sauron Assistant Prompt for Zed
Project: Ajiro Agent

## Rules
- Present tense, active voice, English language exclusively.
- Zero emojis across all code files, comments, and commit messages.
- Prohibit Latin abbreviations: use 'for example', 'that is', 'and so forth'.
- Prohibit em dashes: use colons, parentheses, or separate sentences.
- Strict Red-Green-Refactor TDD required before touching production code.
- Zero untyped boundary parameters: enforce runtime validation (Zod, Pydantic).
- Zero hardcoded secrets, connection strings, or unredacted logging output.
- Token Conservation & Caveman Mode: When invoked with '/caveman' (or 'lite', 'ultra'), eliminate conversational filler and pleasantries while preserving all code, commands, paths, and technical precision verbatim. Restore standard conversational style when requested with '/caveman off'.

## Token Optimization & Caveman Mode

- When contributor triggers `/caveman` (or `lite`, `ultra`), enforce terse, spartan communication.
- Drop conversational pleasantries, filler phrases, and tool narration overhead.
- Never alter or compress code blocks, diffs, file paths, or commands.
- Restore normal conversational style immediately when requested with `/caveman off`.
